program design for program 2 

initialization

create class for process{
	int priority;
	int subtime;
	int burst time;
}
*note[
waitingTime = startTime - arrivalTime

turnaroundTime = burstTime + waitingTime = finishTime- arrivalTime
startTime = Time at which the process started executing

finishTime = Time at which the process finished executing
]

variables in main:
double avgWait;
double avgTround;
double throughput; 

int numproc;


steps:
initiate variables in main

read from csv to create process objects for each csv process and store in arraylist [loop]
